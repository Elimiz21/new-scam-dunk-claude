DEPLOYMENT STATUS - SCAM DUNK
=============================
Last Updated: November 5, 2025 - 4:20 PM EET

✅ LOCAL ENVIRONMENT: Working
- URL: http://localhost:3000
- All APIs functional
- New pricing displayed correctly

⏳ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT: Verification Blocked
- GitHub: Local branch `feature/live-testing-prep` contains new `/api/health` route (not yet pushed/merged).
- Vercel: Health check at https://scam-dunk-production.vercel.app/api/health still returns 404 (see docs/testing/sprint3/raw-data/phase5-production-health.txt).
- Action needed: Deploy latest branch to production (or update health endpoint expectation) so monitoring can pass.

To manually check deployment:
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/eli-mizrochs-projects/scam-dunk-production
2. Check "Deployments" tab for build status
3. Production URL: https://scam-dunk-production.vercel.app
