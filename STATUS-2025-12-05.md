# Project Status — December 5, 2025

## Snapshot
- Branch: `work`
- Cleanup: removed obsolete status/log/test artifacts, a stray generated TypeScript build info file, an unused legacy global stylesheet, a nested duplicate package-lock, and the old static marketing stub to reduce repo noise.
- Current focus: stabilize the Next.js app in `packages/web` and ensure AI-backed scan endpoints are wired with real keys for production.

## Immediate next steps to go live
1. **Install dependencies**
   - `npm install` (root) then `npm --prefix packages/web install` to refresh locks after the cleanup.
2. **Set critical env vars in `packages/web/.env.local` (or the hosting provider)**
   - Supabase auth/session: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (used in middleware and admin env checks).
   - AI + analysis backends: at minimum `OPENAI_API_KEY` plus any model-specific keys your detection pipeline requires (see `.env.production.example` for the full matrix including Google, Azure, AWS, AlphaVantage/Polygon, Chainalysis/Elliptic, etc.).
   - Public API base if different from the Next runtime: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (defaults to `/api`).
3. **Run sanity checks locally**
   - `npm --prefix packages/web run lint` (now clean after fixing the chat scan handler braces).
   - `npm run dev` to ensure middleware no longer 500s once Supabase vars are present.
4. **Verify AI functionality end-to-end**
   - Exercise `/scan/chat`, `/scan/contact`, `/scan/trading`, `/scan/veracity`, and the comprehensive scan with real API keys to confirm streaming updates and risk cards render from live responses.
   - Confirm `/api/admin/check-env` reports all required keys as “Set”.
5. **Production readiness**
   - Create deployment secrets using `.env.production.example` as the baseline, wire Sentry DSN if desired, and enable HTTPS/telemetry opt-outs as needed.
   - Push `work` to `origin` and trigger your hosting pipeline (e.g., Vercel) once env secrets are configured.
