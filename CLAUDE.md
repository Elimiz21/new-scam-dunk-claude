## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **Full Context**: Always ensure you have complete understanding of the entire codebase and intended functionality before making changes
- **High Standards**: Adhere to high-spec coding standards with smart architectural integrity
- **Testing**: Test everything you recommend, then retest in a live development environment to ensure no bugs or errors
- **Explanation**: Always explain your recommendations and progress clearly
- **Autonomy**: Once plans are approved, implement as autonomously as possible without requiring approval or actions from the user

### Important Instructions
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one  
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested
- Only use emojis if explicitly requested
