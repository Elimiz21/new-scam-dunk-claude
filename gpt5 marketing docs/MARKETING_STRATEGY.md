# Scam Dunk Marketing Strategy

## Executive Summary
- Mission: Protect consumers from sophisticated financial scams with fast, AI‑powered diagnostics.

- Targets (6 months): 1M visitors, 50K users, 10K subscribers. Zero/lean budget focus with creator collaborations and programmatic SEO.
- Positioning: “Fastest multi‑signal scam screener with market‑manipulation detection.” Diagnostic, not advisory.

## 1) Market Intelligence

### Competitive Landscape (adjacent)
- Consumer scam checkers: Bitdefender Scamio (chat), Trend Micro Check, ScamAdviser.

- Wallet/tx risk: Etherscan warnings, Chainabuse (community).

- Attainable 6‑month SOM: 50K users, 10K paid, if content velocity + creator distribution land.

### Trends & Timing
- AI scam detection awareness rising; scam education content performs on Shorts/TikTok/YouTube.
- Regulatory scrutiny on claims—disclaimers required.

### SWOT
- Strengths: Multi‑test capability; compelling price‑manipulation wedge; rapid iteration; web live.
- Weaknesses: No brand assets/social proof; zero prior audience; API cost exposure.
- Opportunities: Programmatic SEO; creator partnerships; PRable data stories.
- Threats: Overclaim risk; brigading; copycats; paid CAC volatility.
